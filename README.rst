Overview
========

The Password Reset Tool hooks into the standard mechanisms for
password mailing provided by the CMF in the Registration Tool and
certain skins and replaces this with a facility for resetting
passwords with email authentication.

This is useful not only to keep passwords out of cleartext email and
is absolutely necessary if you choose to encrypt your passwords (and
you should.)

See the INSTALL.txt file for details on installation, and the
LICENSE.txt file for the license this Product is under.

Note, of course, that you must have a working MailHost to send email!

The Password Reset Sequence from the User's Point of View

The user will observe the following steps.

- User forgets a password and

- clicks "Forgot your password?", which

- goes to a form that asks for a username. User fills this in and
  clicks a button to proceed, which

- goes to a form explaining that an email has been sent.

- User receives an email with a URL containing a random,
  unguessable key and opens it in a web browser.

- This is a form that asks for username and password, which goes to

- a form reporting success (or failure, if expired or illegitimate.)

Management Notes
----------------

Configuration of the tool is done through the 'Overview' page
in the ZMI. The options are explained there.

Reset requests are stored in a persistent dictionary in the
tool. Removing the tool or uninstalling the product will destroy
all reset requests.

A facility for clearing expired requests is not yet provided. It
will be in the next release. This should be used occasionally to
clear out the storage. A cron script using 'wget' or 'curl' (or
the Windows equivalent) to automate the procedure is suggested.

Notes
-----

* You can turn username entry off, if you so desire, as this will
  streamline the process. You SHOULD NOT DO THIS if you are
  concerned about account security. Not requiring re-entry of the
  user name allows trivial email-sniffing attacks and makes
  brute-forcing of the reset request keys possible (if unlikely).
  Only private portals should even consider this.

* The URL for the confirmation visit now uses traversal-style URL
  parameters to encode the key. The old get-parameter paths will
  still work, so don't worry about password reset request performed
  before an upgrade

  The traversal_subpath urls (like passwordreset/123lkj43508) are
  now the default. If you like the old style, you'll have to modify
  the skins yourself.

* This tool replaces the built-in password mailing feature. This
  means that the first half of a "forgotten password transaction"
  depends on skin names set in CMF code.

  However, it can be made independent, if you so desire. Simply
  provide an equivalent to:

  - 'mail_password_form':
    Asks for your username, and provides instructions as to what's to come.

  - 'mail_password':
    Receives the request from mail_password_form, calls 'requestReset' on
    the tool, and sends a message with the return URL however you care to
    construct it (usually in 'pwreset_constructURL', which depends on what
    the equivalent to 'passwordreset' is named.) Returns the equivalent of
    'mail_password_response'.

  - 'mail_password_template':
    Provides the basic headers and text of the email, for extraction
    and parsing for use by a mail sender.

  - 'mail_password_response':
    Informs that the mail has been sent.
    Naturally, the methods and templates on the other side will need
    to be migrated over or have equivalents made as well. If outside
    the CMF, certain source changes will also be needed, such as
    overriding 'getValidUser'.

* This tool has been made with customization in mind. There are
  several customization points in the code that should allow you
  to change certain policies simply by subclassing the tool and
  overriding one or two methods.
