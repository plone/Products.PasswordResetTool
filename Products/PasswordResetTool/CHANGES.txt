  - Providing 'fullname' now for email notification. This does not really
    close http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6680, but makes it possible to
    use the information the user provided in the mail notification (and its
    translations).

  - If available use the email_charset property instead of default_charset to
    encode mails.

  - Added the portal name to the subject in the registered_notify_template.pt,

    closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5242.
