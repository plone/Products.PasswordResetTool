  properties (see https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/216).
  [jcerjak]

  [davisagli]


2.0.16 (2014-01-27)

  the portal, enabling support for multilingual sites and other subsites

  [regebro]


2.0.15 (2013-08-13)
-------------------

- Nothing changed yet.

- Always try to look up what the user entered as a login name before
  treating it as a user id.
  [davisagli]

- Make sure password reset form action url is based on the reset tool and not
  the "passwordreset" python script. Fixes issue where the "passwordreset"
  was executed before the pwreset_form action handler was traversed to and
  caused an error before the reset request could even be attempted.
  [vangheem]


2.0.13 (2013-03-17)
-------------------

- Fix exception when use_email_as_login is on and the user enters

  [davisagli]

- registered_notify_template.pt: show login name instead of user id.
  Normally this is the same, but this is not necessarily true when
  using the email address as login name.
  [maurits]


2.0.9 (2012-08-30)
------------------

- Changed deprecated getSiteEncoding to hardcoded `utf-8`
  [tom_gross]

------------------

- Be less sensitive for white space differences in tests.
  [maurits]


2.0.7 (2011-11-24)
------------------

- getExpirationTimeout() now returns the correct number of hours, and not a value 24*24 times too low.
  (The code was never used though, since _timedelta does currently not store a timedelta but an int.)
  [kleist]

------------------

- Apply patch to prevent exploitation of CVE-2011-1948 (Hotfix 20110531.)

------------------

- Depend on ``Products.CMFPlone`` instead of ``Plone``.

  in environments where userid and login name are not equal. This fixes
  `Plone ticket 1136 <http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11136>`_.
  [wichert]

2.0.1 - 2010-07-31
------------------

- Added line feed after the reset_url in mail_password_template.
  It was impossible to reset the password by clicking the url because

  ones don't work in Python 2.6.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9743
  [dukebody]

- Changed registration email to not rely on the request to hold the full name;
  instead the new member object is queried.
  [mj]

2.0b5 - 2010-01-28
------------------

- Changed mail_password_template.pt to the one proposed by limi:

    The following link will take you to a page where you can reset your
    password for XYZsite:

    http://example.com/resetpassword/c635bf8d892f4f30dd868d16c1
    (This link is valid for X days)

    If you didn't expect to receive this email, please ignore it.
    Your password has not been changed.

  This close ticket
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8694
  [amleczko]

  True, we try to get the member by login name when userid gives no

---

  use the information the user provided in the mail notification (and its
