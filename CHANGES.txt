  [wichert]

2.0.1 - 2010-07-31

    The following link will take you to a page where you can reset your
    password for XYZsite:

    http://example.com/resetpassword/c635bf8d892f4f30dd868d16c1
    (This link is valid for X days)

    If you didn't expect to receive this email, please ignore it.

  This close ticket

---

  use the information the user provided in the mail notification (and its
